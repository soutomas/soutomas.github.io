# Tomás Sou

Explorer. Pharmacist. Researcher. Foodie. Snapper.

I like travelling and can’t seem to find enough time to see the world. I care about people and want to contribute to the health and well-being of communities. I look into science in the hope of advancing our future with it. I’m grateful for nice cuisines and wish for more opportunities to indulge my taste. I cherish beautiful scenes and give my best shots to capture the moments.

I am a registered pharmacist in Australia and a research scientist specialising in integrated pharmaceutical R&D. I have over 10 years of combined clinical and R&D experience supporting the development and clinical use of medicines in multinational corporations and consortia. The interest of my work revolves around the synergistic application of data analytics and drug delivery science in predictive pharmacology and quantitative medicine to accelerate the development of new treatments.

If you would like to know more about my work, please feel free to contact me and follow for updates.
