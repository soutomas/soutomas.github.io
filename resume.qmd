# Purpose

The development of innovative medicines is a long and costly endeavour. With the ongoing advancement of technology, I believe data analytics with modelling and simulation will play an increasingly important role in modern drug discovery and development.

For 10+ years in clinical practice and pharmaceutical R&D in multinational corporations and consortia, I have developed multidisciplinary expertise throughout the drug development process in global cross-functional project teams.

The interest of my work revolves around the synergistic application of data analytics and drug delivery science in predictive pharmacology and quantitative medicine, to support data-driven decisions in pharmaceutical R&D and the optimal use of medicines.

Ultimately, I hope to bring more effective and safer treatments to patients more efficiently, with better medicines by design.

# Expertise

# Highlights

## Oncology / Haematology  

Blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterised by dysfunctional immune system and leukaemic stem cell proliferation.

In oncology, thrombocytopenia is a commonly reported dose-limiting toxicity. In one project, I contributed to understanding of intertwining effects of drug and disease on platelet dynamics in haematological malignancies to support dosing decisions in cancer patients.

## Neuroscience

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In MS, patients experience a wide range of life-limiting symptoms, ranging from problems with vision, movement and sensation to fatigue, pain and issues with memory and thinking.

In neuroscience, I support the clinical development and registration of new generation disease-modifying therapies for MS and other neurological conditions, for the development of small-molecules and biologics.

In one project, I supported evaluating the use of continuous-time Markov models as a means for fitting disease progression models in MS using the NO.MS dataset, which is the largest clinical trial dataset for MS complied by Novartis and Oxford, containing data from approximately 35,000 patients spanning all MS phenotypes and including up to 15 years of follow-up.

## Nanobody®

Nanobody molecules belong to a new class of biologics that are derived from heavy-chain-only peptides and are around a tenth the size of conventional antibodies.

In Sanofi, as a clinical pharmacometrician in development project teams, I contributed to the population PK/PD modelling and simulation activities for the development of both small molecules and biologics in clinical studies (FIH to Ph3), including first-in-human evaluation, proof-of-concept study design, international submission, labelling extension, paediatrics extrapolation and alternative dosing regimen exploration.

In one project, I was involved in preparing the submission package to PMDA in Japan for extending the use of caplacizumab to paediatric patients in the Japanese population. Due to the indication being a rare disease, dose extrapolation using a modelling approach, without any clinical data in paediatric patients, was used to support this submission.

## Global health

Every year nearly 300,000 women die due to pregnancy-related causes, with the risk of a woman in a developing country dying from a maternal-related cause during her lifetime around 23 times higher than a woman living in a developed country.

In GSK, as a formulation scientist and a project liaison, I successfully helped establish and secure the industrial-academic partnership between GSK and Monash, for the joint development of a novel inhaled formulation for maternal health in developing countries.

Specifically, as an inventor of the patent, I led the technical transfer and product translation in the development of a novel inhaled formulation for pulmonary delivery of biologics and supported its development feasibility study, which eventually resulted in a co-development and licensing agreement.

## Antimicrobials / ENABLE

The European Gram-negative Antibacterial Engine (ENABLE) is a consortium under the Innovative Medicines Initiatives (IMI) funded by the EU. It is a public-private partnership for the development of new treatments with industry partners to combat antimicrobial resistance.

In this consortium, I represented the pharmacometrics function from Uppsala University in cross-functional project teams to support the development of new antimicrobials for industry partners. Specifically, I contributed to the PK/PD modelling and simulation activities in industrial projects, including preclinical and translational PK and PK/PD modelling of apramycin for human dose prediction and clinical translation.

Uppsala University is home to world-leading research groups in pharmacometrics and predictive PKPD.

## Antimicrobials / JPIAMR

The Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) is an EU supported initiative to combat antimicrobial resistance. I was part of the SENBIOTAR consortium funded by the programme, representing the ADME/DMPK and the drug delivery functions from Uppsala University in the global cross-functional project team.

In this consortium, I contributed to the screening and optimisation of novel compounds in search of candidates for early development. Specifically, I supported activities in compound characterisation and early formulation development, led and coordinated internal and external in vitro and in vivo studies for preclinical ADME/DMPK evaluation and performed preclinical PK/PD modelling to support drug candidate selection.

Uppsala University is home to UDOPP, a pharmaceutical and ADMET platform that provides support in drug discovery and early drug development projects.

## Inhalation & Vaccines

The unique physiology and high absorptive capacity of the lung, physiologically designed for rapid gaseous exchange, provide a potential entry route for compounds that cannot be absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract.

In Monash University, I was a research scientist investigating the development of dry powder formulations suitable for systemic delivery of biotherapeutics such as peptides and vaccines via inhalation.

Monash University was recognised as number #1 in the world in the 2022 QS World University Rankings by Subject for Pharmacy and Pharmacology.

## Medication Management

In Australia, consultant pharmacists ensure their patients’ medications are appropriate, effective, as safe as possible and used correctly. We identify, resolve, and prevent medication-related problems that may interfere with the goals of therapy.

The Australian Association of Consultant Pharmacy (AACP) and, since 2023, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (PSA) are the major credentialing bodies responsible for the accreditation of consultant pharmacists. They promote and seek recognition for the practice of consultant pharmacy and the provision of value-added, professional services in Australia.

For over 10 years as a consultant pharmacist accredited by the AACP, I have served the Australian community and provided clinical services to patients and medical practitioners to promote the optimal use of medicines.

## United Nations Volunteers

The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme is a United Nations organisation that contributes to peace and development through volunteerism worldwide.

In the UNV programme, I supported research on the political economy of health issues for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
